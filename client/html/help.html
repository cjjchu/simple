        <h4>1、Main purpose of this APP </h4>
        <p>To apply or not apply an DB2 for z/OS PTF to production system is a question. System administrators often consider
          many factors before making a Software maintenance decision, and they are very cautious when implementing the changes.
          The IBM z Service Advisor mobile App is a smart z Systems software maintenance solution with a mobile App client.
          This app assists administrators of z Systems software to easily access z Service information from IBM. It pushes
          the urgent service information such as HIPERs, PEs or Red Alerts for DB2 and CICS to the mobile client, and it
          provides the impact evaluation and recommendations to customers to facilitate the maintenance decision. It also can
          help customers check and understand the maintenance status/risk of the system.</p>
